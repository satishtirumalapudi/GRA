The intial preprocessing file has all the preprocessing of the stack overflow dataset chosen,where we have selected the required columns for our project 

Initial creation was combination of all the common tags and their user ids

Then we created edge list based on the common tags identified 

We combined the dictinoary of edge list with the vertex and the scores accordingly 


Then we created the matrix for smaller size co-boundary matrix for the smaller graph created
